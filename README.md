# Dotfiles

This directory contains all the dotfiles for my systems.<br>
Currently using Linux and macOS.

## Installation

Simply run the installer script from your command line

```
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flnbrt/dotfiles/main/installer/install_dotfiles.sh | bash
```
Everything else should then be done by the automatic installation procedure.

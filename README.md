# Dotfiles

This directory contains all the dotfiles for my systems.<br>
Currently using Linux and macOS.

## Installation

First, check out the dotfiles repo in your $HOME directory using git

```
https://github.com/flnbrt/dotfiles.git $HOME/dotfiles
```

Then copy the ```.bashrc``` file from ```$HOME/dotfiles``` to ```$HOME``` and source the file.<br>
Everything else should then be done by the automatic installation procedure.

```
cp $HOME/dotfiles/.bashrc $HOME
source $HOME/.bashrc
```
